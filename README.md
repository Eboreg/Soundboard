Well, it's a custom soundboard. I didn't find any I thought were good enough, so I decided to make one myself, and learn Android programming in the process. It doesn't come with any sounds included (except for a little easter egg -- see if you can find it), you'll have to add those yourself. You can move stuff around, create categories, set individual volumes, zoom by pinching, etc. I'm trying to make it as low latency as possible.

I'm making this available on Google Play to see how it works and perhaps reach some kind of audience, but I plan to mainly publish on F-Droid as soon as I'm sufficiently satisfied with it. Please, free yourself from corporate Big Brother. Use open source software and services that don't invade your privacy. It will be best for all of us in the long run.

Note: The app will copy all selected files to its internal storage. This is mostly because Android only allows max 128 URI permissions to persist across reboots. So the app will occupy quite some space if you add lots of large audio files.
