Do some primitive priming without AudioTrack (pre-load a full buffer and keep it in memory)


Can I get sound "range select" to work over category boundaries?


Category.order does not seem to get set on category createion!


Somehow detect how long time has gone between clicking on a sound card and sound actually beginning
playing, and bail if some timeout has reached (could happen during heavy load).


Maybe save repress mode and reinit on activity restart? (Not necessarily on application restart;
I just want to preserve it when switching between activities)


Steps to speed up time from click to sound starting playing:
* Intercept the touch event as soon as possible (i.e. in the activity), send straight to play
method without middlemen
* Play on touch event in SoundViewHolder, instead of click event


Layout takes lots of time (well, mostly while debugging, not so much on regular runs).
Mostly RecyclerView.onMeasure() and ConstraintLayout.onMeasure() (for
individual sounds). How to optimize? Something with autoMeasure perhaps?

Look at backup_descriptor.xml stuff


When collapsing last category, its header disappears from view until you scroll, then reappears
CategoryAdapter.onViewDetachedFromWindow() is run for that holder and it's hidden. Why?


On ordering enabled: scroll with 2 fingers?


Clean up Log calls


After altering a category, play icon & volumebar on sounds dont work? (Cannot recreate?)


In some instance, when creating categories and moving sounds around, an empty category was
populated with another category's sounds (How to recreate?)


Check for usages of adapterPosition/layoutPosition and correct according to
https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/recyclerview/widget/RecyclerView#positions-in-recyclerview:


Make sure old adapters & viewholders are garbage collected on config change/rotate, they don't seem
to be doing so automatically


Write tests :-//////////////
