Trash CategoryListFragment, put it all in MainActivity?

Try setting AudioAttributes: https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/android/media/AudioAttributes
- FLAG_LOW_LATENCY (Deprecated: Use AudioTrack.Builder#setPerformanceMode(int) with AudioTrack#PERFORMANCE_MODE_LOW_LATENCY to control performance.)
- USAGE_MEDIA

Maybe not use LiveData for SoundViewModel and CategoryViewModel attributes at all, but rely on them
updating when their respective ListViewModel updates?
