Don't redraw the whole thing for each little change

State of "new category" fragment doesn't persist during orientation change

Implement deletion of category WITH items

Drag sounds between categories? Is it even possible?

Try setting AudioAttributes: https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/android/media/AudioAttributes
- FLAG_LOW_LATENCY (Deprecated: Use AudioTrack.Builder#setPerformanceMode(int) with AudioTrack#PERFORMANCE_MODE_LOW_LATENCY to control performance.)
- USAGE_MEDIA

Maybe not use LiveData for SoundViewModel and CategoryViewModel attributes at all, but rely on them
updating when their respective ListViewModel updates?
