Does AddSoundDialogFragment work when rotating screen? -- No
Viewmodels persist during config changes so we can use those. Just make sure there is a way for
the fragments to pick up after being restarted

Maybe edit several sounds at once? (have to implement 'select' funcionality)
Pinch to zoom

Impose limits on zoomLevel (can't zoom in further when spanCount is already 1).
Would have to be re-checked on each config change/screen rotation etc.

Try setting AudioAttributes: https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/android/media/AudioAttributes
- FLAG_LOW_LATENCY (Deprecated: Use AudioTrack.Builder#setPerformanceMode(int) with AudioTrack#PERFORMANCE_MODE_LOW_LATENCY to control performance.)
- USAGE_MEDIA

Maybe not use LiveData for SoundViewModel and CategoryViewModel attributes at all, but rely on them
updating when their respective ListViewModel updates?
