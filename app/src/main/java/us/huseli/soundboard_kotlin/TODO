SoundViewModel.zoomLevel: Refuse to add when SoundListFragment.view.layoutManager.spanCount == 1

Try setting AudioAttributes: https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/android/media/AudioAttributes
- FLAG_LOW_LATENCY (Deprecated: Use AudioTrack.Builder#setPerformanceMode(int) with AudioTrack#PERFORMANCE_MODE_LOW_LATENCY to control performance.)
- USAGE_MEDIA

Maybe not use LiveData for SoundViewModel and CategoryViewModel attributes at all, but rely on them
updating when their respective ListViewModel updates?


Reorder button erroneously says it's enabled to begin with, and does not change layout


category.soundcount not working
