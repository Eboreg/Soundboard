Add several sounds at once
Maybe even edit several? (have to implement 'select' funcionality)
Pinch to zoom

Impose limits on zoomLevel (can't zoom in further when spanCount is already 1).
Would have to be re-checked on each config change/screen rotation etc.

Trash CategoryViewModel?

Drag sounds between categories? Is it even possible?

Trash CategoryListFragment, put it all in MainActivity?

######## MAYBES #########

Try setting AudioAttributes: https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/android/media/AudioAttributes
- FLAG_LOW_LATENCY (Deprecated: Use AudioTrack.Builder#setPerformanceMode(int) with AudioTrack#PERFORMANCE_MODE_LOW_LATENCY to control performance.)
- USAGE_MEDIA

Maybe not use LiveData for SoundViewModel and CategoryViewModel attributes at all, but rely on them
updating when their respective ListViewModel updates?
