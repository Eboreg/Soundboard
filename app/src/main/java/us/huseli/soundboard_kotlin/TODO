Don't redraw the whole thing for each little change

"Playing" overlays don't persist during orientation change

State of "new category" fragment doesn't persist during orientation change

Color list won't scroll all the way down in landscape mode. And if I change number of columns, it
doesn't change the dialog width so it all looks weird. Find some better colorpicker.

Try setting AudioAttributes: https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/android/media/AudioAttributes
- FLAG_LOW_LATENCY (Deprecated: Use AudioTrack.Builder#setPerformanceMode(int) with AudioTrack#PERFORMANCE_MODE_LOW_LATENCY to control performance.)
- USAGE_MEDIA

Maybe not use LiveData for SoundViewModel and CategoryViewModel attributes at all, but rely on them
updating when their respective ListViewModel updates?
